## Project Overview

A simple and effective BJJ class feedback form. Students scan their gym's custom QR code which then submits an anonymous form giving feedback on positives, areas of improvement, questions or concerns around BJJ classes. The gym owners/coaches will receive a weekly email digest of their class feedback. 

## üöÄ Purpose

Many BJJ gyms could be run more tailored to their students. Often times students feel uncomfrtable giving their coaches feedback, or raising concerns about the gym, training methods, or other students. We are helping mitigate this uncomfortable yet important step in the process of improving your BJJ gym experience.
